<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm FELICIA NAA DROMO JACOBSON. I'm 19years of age. I stay at Lapaz a suburb of Greater Accra in Ghana.

  Ghana Communication Technology University is where i'm currently offering Bachelor of Infomation Systems a 4-year degree program. I'm in Level 200. 
  Information System is all about the combination of business and Technology. There are many careers in this course and they are; Systems Analyst, Programmer, Data Analyst, Information Systems Analyst,Business Analyst and more.

  Upon looking at the careers in this program , Data Analyst is what i want to build on and work with after my degree program. I love everything about data , solving problems and share information through data. There's more to do as a data Analyst. 
  I also want to be a Web Developer and that's why i'm learning Wed Development with Angela on Udemy. Best tutor ever:) .

  To sum up , I'm a lady who is ambitious and eager to overcome all my dreams, plans or vision. Succes is what i'm aiming at the end and not failure . One word for myself is <em>"Don't Give Up on your Dreams,Sleep is for the weak".</em>
